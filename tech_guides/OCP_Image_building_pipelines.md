# OCP Image building pipelines

## Create a BuildConfig

a BuildConfig is an object that holds all settings of the image you intend to build.

In console left pane, click on **Builds** â†’ **BuildConfigs**, then **Create a new BuildConfig** on the right.

In **Source** select **Dockerfile** and provide the Dockerfile content.

In **Build from** select **External container image**, provide the source image address.

In **Image registry** select **External container image**, provide the destination image address.

Once done, click **Create**.

## Create a docker credentials secret for remote repository

run to create the secret in the same namespace:

```bash
kubectl -n lolz create secret \
  docker-registry zebra-creds \
  --docker-server=docker.io \
  --docker-username=<DOCKER_USERNAME> \
  --docker-password=PASSWORD \
  --docker-email=bla@bla.net
```

edit the builder serviceAccount in the same namespace:

```bash
kubectl -n lolz edit sa builder
```

then add the secret to it:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
imagePullSecrets:
- name: builder-dockercfg-6ffrp
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: builder
  namespace: lolz
secrets:
- name: builder-dockercfg-6ffrp
**- name: zebra-creds**
```

## Build the image

Head back to the **BuildConfig** created earlier, in its 3 dot menu select **Start Build**.

This will generate a new **Build** object, redirects you to it and starts the build process.

Head over to **Logs** in the **Build** object, to see the build process stdout stream.

If the build is successful, the image will be pushed to the tag provided.

<aside>
ðŸ”¥ Unlike manually running `docker/podman build` command, there is no cache, and steps arenâ€™t being cached. So each time your build fails, and you fix the step in the BuildConfig and run it again, all prior steps will be run again from scratch.
